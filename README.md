# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
<!-- explain the purpose of this election audit analysis -->
The purpose of this election audit was to determine the winner of the election as well as know the total votes.  Next, we analyzed the count and the percentage of vote for each candidate. We also had to find the total votes per county and percentage of votes per county, and determine which county had the largest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary
<!-- Provie business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used - with some modifications- for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections --> 
### Buisness Proposal

There are multiple elections that are held besides congressional elections; therefore, this can be used on any election. Other elections goal is to find the total votes, percentage of outcomes, as well as determine the winner. With a few modifications, we can use the code that was develop and apply it to find the answers.  

### Script Modifications for Future Elections

In order for the script to be used in other elections there needs to be some modifications. One of the modifications that would have to be done is adjust the code to the correct csv file or the file that contains the information needed for the election results. Another modification that would be required to modify is where the script will be saved in the text file. A different text file name will be needed to save the anaylsis results. 

File that contains data would be modified in this section

Script would be saved to a different file and cause this code to be modified
