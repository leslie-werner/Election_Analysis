## Ellection-Audit Summary
<!-- Provie business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used - with some modifications- for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections --> 
### Buisness Proposal

Every state has elections therefore, this can be used on any election. With a few modifications, we can use the code that was develop and apply it to other elections. 

### Script Modifications for Future Elections

    One of the modifications that would have to be done is adjust the code to the correct csv file. Another modification that would be required for the script to be used in any election would be to have save the results to the specific file that will script the results.
