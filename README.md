# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
<!-- explain the purpose of this election audit analysis -->
The purpose of this election audit was to determine the winner of the election as well as total votes of the election. We also had to find the total votes per county and percentage of votes per county, and determine which county had the largest turnout. Next, we analyzed the count and the percentage of vote for each candidate.

## Election-Audit Summary
<!-- Provie business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used - with some modifications- for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections --> 
### Buisness Proposal

Every state has elections therefore, this can be used on any election. With a few modifications, we can use the code that was develop and apply it to other elections. 

### Script Modifications for Future Elections

One of the modifications that would have to be done is adjust the code to the correct csv file. Another modification that would be required for the script to be used in any election would be to have save the results to the specific file that will script the results. 

File that contains data would be modified in this section

Script would be saved to different file and code would be modified
